                    <p class="p3">Instead of cooking pasta in a huge pot of water, here we use just 3Â½ cups for this one-pot pasta recipe.<br/>
                    When the pasta is al dente, most of the water has evaporated and the bit that's left is thickened with the<br/>
                    starch that cooks off the pasta. With just a few add-ins like lemon and Parmesan cheese you have a<br/>
                    delicious silky sauce. Want to use up your veggie stash in the freezer? Swap in 8 ounces frozen spinach<br/>
                    for fresh.</p>
